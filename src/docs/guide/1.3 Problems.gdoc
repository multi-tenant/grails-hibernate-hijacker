h3. Intercepting new sessions

Hibernate has a rich event API, but for some reason it doesn't expose new sessions. 
There is a [SessionFactoryObserver|https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/javadocs/org/hibernate/SessionFactoryObserver.html], but no SessionObserver.
This is needed to do things like enabling Hibernate filters. Creating a non-intrusive / violent solution to this turned out to be incredible difficult.
